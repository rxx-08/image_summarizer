Hi!
I heard understanding how MLOps works is cool.
This project is my attempt at it.
You give the frontend an image. It extracts the text using OCR and gives a summary. At least thats what the 1st version doed, I have more ideas for future features I want to add.
The main goal is to understand the CI/CD pipeline, and get familiar with various services that work on CI. 
Connected this to render, have a backend too.
The extracted text from the uploaded image and their respective summaries are stored in that along with a timestamp.
Properly used git commands this time round as well.
Used Docker for the containerization part.

This is a pretty shit README but hey, we live and we learn.
Cheers!
